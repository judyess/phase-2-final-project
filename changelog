Changing program to work with JSONified data instead of working from an array of the data. JSON.stringify doesn't mutate the data. (is mutate the right word?)

Used JSON.stringify(data) in the fetch call to convert the data, instead of using Object.entries(data) and then having to create another variable to hold the "array-version". I suspect that using Object.entries was mutating the server data anyway.

Removed a lot of variables holding redundant data.

removed const localData from Form because it was holding Object.entries(serverData). Replaced const localData with the direct reference to the prop.

(!!!) Temporarily Storing the code I used to handle deleting objects and replacing them here, to reduce clutter (!!!)

        const [deleteItems, setDeleteItems] = useState([]);

    // adding to DeleteItems works, check that the form is updating correctly. 
    function handleKey(event, item){
        event.preventDefault();
        let newKey = event.target.value;
        if (!deleteItems.includes(item[0])){
            setDeleteItems((deleteItems)=>[...deleteItems, item[0]]); 
        }console.log(newKey);}
